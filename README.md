# Project Structure

This project follows the MVVM architecture pattern with a clean and modular structure.

## Folder Overview

### `data`
- Handles all data-related operations, including models, repositories, and services.

### `ui`
- Manages the user interface, including views and viewmodels.

### `utils`
- Contains utility classes and helper functions for common tasks.

## Best Practices
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle: Each class should have one responsibility.
- Use dependency injection (e.g., Hilt) to decouple dependencies.
- Write unit tests for ViewModels and Repositories to ensure code quality.
